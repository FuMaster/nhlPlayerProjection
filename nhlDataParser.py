classification of players:

Notes
scope: any NHL player under age of 23 and less than 82 games played at the start of the period
Collect up to first 3 season of data from player
If a player has less than 82 games of data in total, the sample size is too small for evaluation
Then compare projected growth to the average result up until present

The most popular of such statistics is Corsi, which counts the number
of events that are goals, shots on goal, missed shots, or blocked shots. Fenwick is another
statistic; it is Corsi but without counting blocked shots.

QoC	Quality of Competition - Average Corsi of one's opponents
QoT	Quality of Temmates - Average Corsi of one's teammates
RQoC	Quality of Competition Relative to teammates
RQoT	Quality of Teammates Relative to other teammates
